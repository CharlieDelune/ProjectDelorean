# Project Delorean

Project Delorean was a turn-based RPG skeleton made as part of Independent Project coursework at West Chester University.

The challenge I set for myself was to create a set of reusable parts that could be used to build an entire RPG, but **without**
using *any* Asset Store items. The idea was to build it **all** myself.

The game was designed with the following criteria in mind:
* Single player
* Hybrid 2D/3D
* closed-world
* Role-playing game

The game would feature:
* a turn-based battle system
* an inventory system
* stats-based characters
* a level-up system
* state-dependent battle abilities/items
* computer-controlled enemies
* map exploration/interaction
* non-player character interaction via dialogue

To expand a little on the battle system, the idea was to take inspiration from both classic and modern Final Fantasy games. The
battle system would be traditionally turn-based with a set turn order, but feature a rudimentary grid-based movement system that
players could use to move their characters out of the path of larger telegraphed attacks. Additionally, it would feature "modes"
for each character to switch between, such as Attack mode and Defense mode. These modes would not only alter their stats, but
indeed even their available skills.

## The current status of this project:

The computer I originally designed this project on no longer exists on this plane of existence... So I pulled the code down from
the cloud and imported it into Unity 2020, and made sure it built and ran. **That is the extent of support I intend to provide
for this project.** It runs, albeit poorly. Many textures are missing. Mason can one-shot everything. But the general idea
of it is there, and most importantly, the title screen music I wrote is still there.
